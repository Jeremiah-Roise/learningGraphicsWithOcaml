## Spinnging cube in Ocaml
this ocaml program uses the tsdl library / connector to display a spinning cube.
It's based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdRJgYO1BJM&list=PLYmIsLVSssdIOn5J71CVBblPlXici1_2A&index=9) showing the same proccess but in C.

I write this spinning cube program in Ocaml because I wanted to learn Ocaml because there's no better way to learn than a massively overscoped project.
